## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:
```
./mvnw quarkus:dev
```

## Packaging and running the application

The application is packageable using `./mvnw package`.
It produces the executable `cmdls-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar` file in `/target` directory.
Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/lib` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/cmdls-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using: `./mvnw package -Pnative`.

Or you can use Docker to build the native executable using: `./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true`.

You can then execute your binary: `./target/cmdls-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-runner`
